Pretty much: 
  As a user
  I want to rate a registered user out of 10 on a crockerometer
  So that their crockeritude rating accurately reflects them

  First off:
    Y'know I am on Genghis Khan's page

  Awww, look mate: rating a user
    Too right 10 people have rated him 0/10
    Yeah nah I then succumb to his gentle persuasion
    Too right I rate him 10 out of 10
    But at the end of the day I reckon his rating is 0.91/10

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's rating
    Too right his rating is 10/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see "Genghis Khan's crockeritude rating: 10/10"

  Awww, look mate: trying to re-vote
    Too right I rate him 2/10
    Too right I rate him 4/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon his rating is 2/10
    Too right I should see a message telling me I've already voted

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's max crockeritude image
    Too right his rating is 10/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see an image: "an_image"

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's min crockeritude image
    Yeah nah his rating is 0/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see an image: "another_image"
