Pretty much: 
  As a user
  I want to rate a registered user out of 10 on a crockerometer
  So that their crockeritude rating accurately reflects them

  Awww, look mate: rating a user
    Y'know I am on Genghis Khan's page
    Too right I rate him 0 out of 10
    Too right I then succumb to his gentle persuasion
    Too right I rate him 10 out of 10
    But at the end of the day I reckon he should have a rating of 5 out of 10

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's rating
    Y'know I am on Genghis Khan's page
    Too right his rating is 10/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see "Genghis Khan's crockeritude rating: 10/10"

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's max crockeritude image
    Y'know I am on Genghis Khan's page
    Too right his rating is 10/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see "an image that I'll figure out later"

  Awww, look mate: viewing a user's min crockeritude image
    Y'know I am on Tom Cruise's page
    Yeah nah his rating is 0/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should see "a different image that I'll figure out later"
