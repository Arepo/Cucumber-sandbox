Pretty much:
  As a user coming from an IP address who's already voted on someone
  I want to be prevented from voting on them again
  So I can't *cough* accidentally distort the ratings

  Awww, look mate: trying to re-vote
    Y'know I am on Tom Cruise's page
    Too right I rate him 2/10
    Too right I rate him 4/10
    But at the end of the day I reckon his rating is 2/10
    Too right I should see a message telling me I've already voted
